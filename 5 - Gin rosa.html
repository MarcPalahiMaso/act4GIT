      <tr>
        <td>Cola</td>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>Pink gin with cola is a combination that might surprise you more than you think. It's really a good combination as the flavors combine well but it's true that the gin is less noticeable.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Juice</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>It's fine if you don't have anything else to mix it with but think you'll miss a lot of the gin taste and the beauty of this drink is basically the taste.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Energetic</td>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>For some reason the energy is phenomenal with pink gin and makes it taste very nice. Highly recommended.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Fanta</td>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>In this case the fanta does a very good job of preserving the taste of the gin and the combination is really good.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Tonic</td>
        <td>9</td>
        <td>This alcoholic drink was born to be mixed with tonic... It is by far the best combination since it does not waste its taste, it levels it up.</td>
      </tr>

        <td>Alone</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>You can't drink it... Without mixing it doesn't bind at all.</td>
