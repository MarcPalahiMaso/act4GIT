          <td>The problem with this mixture is that if the vodka is bad and you use a little 		Coke, it can have a very strong flavor that is unpleasant for the majority of 			people. Although being less strong than black rum the margin is wider.</td>

          <td>Juice</td>
          <td>8</td>
          <td>This mix is really good. If it is made with good juice, ice and the glass is decorated with a slice of fruit, it can become very presentable. It is a good combination since being a soft liquor itself mixed with juice, which further softens the taste, the vodka flavor is almost non-existent. Personally, I recommend pineapple juice, it makes a delicious combination.</td>

          <td>Energetic</td>
          <td>10</td>
          <td>This liqueur with energy is the most delicious. Since the flavor of vodka is not invasive, it can be used with almost any type of energy and give a brutal result, as well as giving a high like few mixes can offer. If you want to get very drunk and very fast, this is undoubtedly the best option.</td>

          <td>Fanta</td>
          <td>6</td>
          <td>I prefer it with lemon fanta although it is indifferent. I don't like this combination very much because its flavor is not very intense and boring, and unlike rum it cannot be saved by external flavors. Instead of fanta, I recommend using lime syrup (which I would give it an 8) to give it a more intense and tasty touch..</td>

          <td>Tonic</td>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>I personally do not recommend this mix. According to my taste, the flavors do not combine at all, if you want to use tonic the best is gin, although there are people who appreciate this cocktail and praise it.</td>

          <td>Its taste depends a lot on the quality. It has a mild and uncharacteristic taste. It's fine for making shots.</td>
