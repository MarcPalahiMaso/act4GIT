          <td>The problem with this mixture is that if the rum is bad and you use a little 		Coke, it can have a very strong flavor that is unpleasant for the majority of 			people.</td>

            <td>Juice</td>
            <td>7</td>
            <td>This mixture is not very common, but if the rum is bad it is an excellent candidate since it absorbs its flavor and softens it a lot.
            To get drunk quickly it is the best thing you can do since you can put a lot of rum and a little juice and even then it will be very little noticeable. It is very good with fruit salad, the problem is that if the rum is good, it is spoiling it.</td>

            <td>7</td>
            <td>This mix works best with vodka or less distinctive spirits, but it's still a 		really nice combination if you want to get a lot drunk with a little. The 				percentage of rum applied can vary, but personally I recommend applying the law 		of 10 seconds.</td>

            <td>Fanta</td>
            <td>7</td>
            <td>Better lemon than orange fanta. It is good in itself but if you want a more 		intense flavor it is advisable to crush mint and lemon in a bowl and add it to 			the mixture.</td>

            <td>4</td>
            <td>I personally do not recommend this mix. According to my taste, the flavors do not combine at all, if you want to use tonic the best is gin, although there are people who appreciate this cocktail and praise it.</td>

            <td>It has a characteristic flavor that differentiates it from other liquors. Although it all depends on the quality, generally a medium class rum is a good drink to have a few drinks with. It is usually taken in a glass with ice due to its strong flavor.</td>
