          <td>Cola</td>
          <td>7</td>
          <td>Normally (put a little or a lot of Coke) the taste of gin always ends up predominating, which is a strong point in the first cubata, but in the second, third or fourth it begins to tire.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Juice</td>
          <td>6</td>
          <td>This mix is interesting as the juice absorbs much of the taste of the alcohol. It is recommended if the gin is of poor quality as it can save the bad taste.
      If the gin is good I don't recommend it.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Energetic</td>
          <td>5</td>
          <td>The tastes simply do not complement each other and it ends up being a rather strange mixture for the palate, but being energetic and gin it rises quite quickly.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Fanta</td>
          <td>8</td>
          <td>The lemon gin is very typical and known throughout the world. The two flavors complement each other very well and create a nice mix for the palate.
      Lemon fanta is undoubtedly one of the best mixes for gin.
      As for the orange fanta, it doesn't combine much, you don't need to try it.</td>

        <tr>
          <td>Tonic</td>
          <td>9</td>
          <td>If you like gin and tonic this is your drink. These drinks were born to be together, without a doubt it is the best combination you can make with gin.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Alone</td>
          <td>7</td>
          <td>It has quite a distinctive taste.
      It is a smooth taste but strong enough to be instantly recognizable.
      Obviously the taste depends on the quality, but a good gin can never be denied.</td>
