        <td>Cola</td>
        <td>8</td>
        <td>White rum and cola is a combination with a very pleasant taste that leaves you wanting more... Its taste is both smooth and sweet. It really is one of the best ways to combine white rum.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Juice</td>
        <td>9</td>
        <td>Personally, the times I've had the best time drinking have been with the combination of juice and white rum... This comes in alone, and it really is a taste that goes together very well.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Energetic</td>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>Energy drinks are also a great combination with this drink... Now, be careful that it rises very quickly but the taste is great.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Fanta</td>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>The fanta also looks great and it really is a very tasty and very good combination... I recommend it without a doubt.</td>

        <td>Alone</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>White rum itself is a strong drink that, even if it doesn't have as much alcohol as others, is hard to swallow... Mix it up, it's not worth.</td>
